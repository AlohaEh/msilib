This is msilib for Python version 3.13.0+
=========================================

Usage
-----
This library can be import as either msilib or pymsilib.

General
-------
MSILib is a python library for creating and manipulating MSI files.
This is legacy code. If you are creating a new project, I strongly suggest 
you do not use MSIs. 

Release Information
-------------------
As of Python 3.13.0, msilib is no longer included in the default build.
This simply takes the existing msilib code and packages it as an extra module.
The original code can be found in the Python Git repository.
It is replicated here with minimal changes.
As such, it is subject to the same terms and conditions.
